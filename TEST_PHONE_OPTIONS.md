# 📱 **Test on Phone - 2 Options**

## **Option 1: Try QR Code Again** 🔄

### **What to Do:**
1. Wait for QR code to appear in terminal
2. Open **Expo Go** app on phone
3. Scan QR code
4. App should load

### **If QR Still Fails:**
- ✅ **This is OK!**
- ✅ Doesn't affect EAS build
- ✅ Common issue with Expo Go
- ✅ Move to Option 2

---

## **Option 2: Build With EAS** ⭐ (RECOMMENDED)

### **This Will Work:**
- Creates **standalone app**
- Doesn't use Expo Go
- No QR code needed
- Install directly on phone

### **How to Do It:**
```bash
# In terminal, run:
eas build --platform android
```

### **What Happens:**
1. EAS builds your app in cloud
2. You get email with download link
3. Download APK file
3. Transfer to phone via USB/email
4. Install APK
5. Open and test!

## **🎯 Which Should You Choose?**

### **Option 1 (QR Code):**
- ✅ Faster (if it works)
- ✅ Good for quick testing
- ❌ Might not work (Expo Go issues)

### **Option 2 (EAS Build):** ⭐
- ✅ Always works
- ✅ Real app experience
- ✅ Test all features properly
- ⏱️ Takes ~20 minutes
- 💰 Needs EAS account (free)

---

## **🚀 My Recommendation:**

**Skip QR code, build with EAS!**
- The "runtime not ready" error is Expo Go's problem
- EAS build won't have this issue
- Get the real app experience
- Worth the 20-minute wait
