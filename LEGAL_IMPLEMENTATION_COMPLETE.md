## 🔧 **What You Need to Do Next**

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are template documents!

Before launching your app, you **MUST**:

1. **Review the Content**
   - Read through both documents carefully
   - Ensure they accurately reflect your app's practices
   - Add any missing information specific to your app

2. **Customize Placeholders** (if you want to use the full MD files)
   - The full versions in `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md` have placeholders
   - Replace `[Your App Name]`, `[Your Company Name]`, etc.
   - See `LEGAL_DOCUMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` for the full list

3. **Get Legal Review** (Highly Recommended!)
   - Have a lawyer review these documents
   - Laws vary by country and region
   - Dating apps have specific legal requirements
   - **I'm an AI, not a lawyer** - these are templates

4. **Update Dates**
   - Change "Last Updated: January 2025" to the actual date
   - Update the date whenever you make changes

5. **Add Contact Information**
   - The documents say "contact us through Help & Support"
   - Make sure you have a working support system
   - Consider adding a specific email address
