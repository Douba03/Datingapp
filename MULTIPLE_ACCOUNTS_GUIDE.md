# 👥 How to Log In 2 Profiles at Same Time

## 🎯 The Solution: Use Incognito/Private Mode

You're using the same browser, so it shares the login session. Here's how to have 2 accounts open at once:

---

## ✅ **Method 1: Normal + Incognito (EASIEST)**

### **Window 1 - Normal Browser (Account 1):**
```
1. Keep your current browser window open
2. Log in as: abdi or qqwqwq
3. Go to: http://localhost:8082
4. Stay on this window
```

### **Window 2 - Incognito (Account 2):**
```
1. Press: Ctrl + Shift + N (Chrome/Edge)
   OR: Ctrl + Shift + P (Firefox)
2. You'll see a dark/private window
3. Go to: http://localhost:8082
4. Log in as: emma.woman@gmail.com (or create this account)
5. This window has separate login session!
```

**Now you have BOTH accounts open at the same time!**

## 🎮 **How to Test:**

### **Arrange Your Windows Side-by-Side:**

```
┌─────────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐
│   Normal Window     │  │  Incognito Window   │
│   (abdi's account)  │  │  (Emma's account)   │
│                     │  │                     │
│   localhost:8082    │  │   localhost:8082    │
│   Discover tab      │  │   Discover tab      │
└─────────────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘
```

### **Test Matching:**

**Left window (abdi):**
```
1. Discover tab → See Emma
2. Swipe RIGHT ❤️
```

**Right window (Emma - incognito):**
```
1. Discover tab → See abdi
2. Swipe RIGHT ❤️
3. MATCH! 🎉
```

**Both windows:**
```
Go to Matches tab → See each other!
```

---

## ✅ **Method 2: Different Browsers (Alternative)**

If incognito doesn't work:

**Browser 1 - Chrome:**
```
Account: abdi
URL: http://localhost:8082
```

**Browser 2 - Firefox/Edge:**
```
Account: Emma
URL: http://localhost:8082
```

Each browser has separate login sessions!

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Setup:**

### **Right Now:**

1. ✅ **Current browser:**
   - Stay logged in as your existing account (abdi/qqwqwq)
   - Go to: http://localhost:8082

2. ✅ **Open incognito:**
   - Press: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
   - Go to: http://localhost:8082
   - Create NEW woman account:
     ```
     Email: emma.final@gmail.com
     Password: test123456
     Name: Emma
     Gender: WOMAN
     Looking for: MEN
     ```

3. ✅ **Both windows open:**
   - Switch between them using Alt+Tab
   - Test swiping and matching!

## 🎯 **How Incognito Works:**

**Normal Window:**
- Has cookies and login session
- Stays logged in as Account A

**Incognito Window:**
- Completely separate session
- No shared cookies
- Can log in as Account B
- Won't affect normal window

**Same localhost:8082 port works for both!**

---

## 🖥️ **Visual Guide:**

### **To Open Incognito:**

**Windows (Chrome/Edge):**
```
Ctrl + Shift + N
```

**Windows (Firefox):**
```
Ctrl + Shift + P
```

**Or click:**
```
Browser menu (⋮) → "New Incognito Window"
```

---

## ✅ **Quick Test:**

```
Step 1: Normal window
- Go to http://localhost:8082
- Log in as existing account

Step 2: Open incognito
- Press Ctrl+Shift+N
- Black/dark window appears
- Go to http://localhost:8082
- Create new account (different email!)

Step 3: You now have 2 accounts!
- Alt+Tab to switch between windows
- Test swipe and match
```

## 🐛 **If Incognito Shares Session:**

This is rare but can happen:

**Solution:** Use completely different browsers:
- Chrome for Account 1
- Firefox for Account 2
- Edge for Account 3

All go to same URL: `http://localhost:8082`

---

## 🎊 **Summary:**

**You DON'T need:**
- ❌ New port
- ❌ Second server
- ❌ Different computer

**You just need:**
- ✅ Normal browser window
- ✅ Incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N)
- ✅ Both go to same URL: localhost:8082

**Try it! Press Ctrl+Shift+N RIGHT NOW to open incognito window! 🚀**
