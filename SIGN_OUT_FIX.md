# ✅ Sign Out Fixed!

## 🔧 What I Fixed

The sign out button now properly:
- Signs you out from Supabase
- Redirects back to login screen
- Clears your session

## 🚀 How to Sign Out Now

### Method 1: Use the Sign Out Button (Fixed!)

1. **Reload the app** (press `r` in terminal)
2. Go to **Profile** tab
3. Scroll down to bottom
4. Click **"Sign Out"** button
5. Confirm **"Sign Out"** in the popup
6. **You'll be redirected to login screen!** ✅

## 💡 Better Method: Use Incognito/Private Mode

**Instead of signing in/out repeatedly**, use multiple browser windows:

### For Testing Multiple Accounts:

**Window 1 - Sarah's Account:**
```
1. Normal Chrome/Edge window
2. Go to: http://localhost:8082
3. Sign in as: sarah.test@gmail.com
4. Keep this window open
```

**Window 2 - Mike's Account:**
```
1. Open Incognito/Private window (Ctrl+Shift+N)
2. Go to: http://localhost:8082
3. Sign in as: mike.test@gmail.com
4. Keep this window open
```

**Now you can:**
- Switch between windows to test both accounts
- No need to sign in/out
- Much faster testing!

## 🧪 Quick Test Flow

### Step 1: Set up both accounts

**Regular window (Sarah):**
```

2. Go to http://localhost:8082
